To run:

	Python3 Question1.py

	Python3 Question2.py

Question 1 - Feed forward neural network in Python that classifies the images found in the MNIST dataset using K-Fold Cross Validation. 

Question 2 - Feed forward Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network in Python that classifies the images found in the MNIST dataset using K-Fold Cross Validation.

       - K-Means Clustering is used to determine the prototype vectors for the hidden RBF layer.
       
       - TODO: use linear classifier in RBF backprop to fix network accuracy
